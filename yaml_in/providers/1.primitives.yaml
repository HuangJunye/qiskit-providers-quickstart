title: Native Primitives
description: Services or software packages that provide native support to Qiskit Primitives. Qiskit Primitives provide a set of interfaces for performing operations such as sampling (Sampler) and estimating (Estimator) that forms the fundamental building blocks of quantum algorithm development.

  - title: IBM Qiskit Runtime
    description: Qiskit Runtime is a quantum computing service and programming model
      that allows users to optimize workloads and efficiently execute them on quantum
      systems at scale. The programming model extends the existing interface in Qiskit
      with a set of new primitive programs.
