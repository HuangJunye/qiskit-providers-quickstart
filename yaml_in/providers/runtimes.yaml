title: Quantum Runtimes
description: Services that allow quantum-classical hybrid computations. Sometimes called near-team computing, this computation model allows relative quick iteration between classical and quantum processors, which is useful for variational algorithms.

    description: Qiskit Runtime is a quantum computing service and programming model
      that allows users to optimize workloads and efficiently execute them on quantum
      systems at scale. The programming model extends the existing interface in Qiskit
      with a set of new primitive programs.
